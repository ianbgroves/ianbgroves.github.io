Here we review the current state of literature surrounding Sonic Hedgehog, an important factor in the development of many organs and tissues - especially the Hypothalamus. We consider the role mathematical modelling has played in understanding the roles of Shh. We conclude by calling for a model integrating Shh as a morphogen, and as a mitogen. This paper was accepted on 02.10.20 and will be published later in the year.
